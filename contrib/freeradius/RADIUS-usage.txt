totpcgi-handler.pl may be used by the embeded perl interpreter for
FreeRADIUS. To use this make sure that toptcgi-handler.yaml is in
/etc/raddb/ along with the perl script.

Modules required for the script to run are:

IO::Socket::SSL
Net::SSLeay
Net::LDAP
Net::LDAP::Util
LWP::UserAgent
YAML::Syck

Expectations of this script are that you have loaded in the FreeRADIUS
LDAP schema extensions into your schema. Upon a successful validation of
the user against totp-cgi the script will then poll LDAP for the user.
The user object must have an objectClass of radiusprofile attached to it
and at least dialupAccess set to TRUE (NOTE the check is case insensitive
and the schema created it as a string instead of boolean).

There is a limited number of attributes that are presently mapped back
out of LDAP as we do not use the rlm_ldap attributes file. To extend the
attributes add to the @attrs & %attrib_map definitions.

The current mapping is as follows:

LDAP Attribute		RADIUS AV
==============		=========
radiusGroupName		Class
radiusFramedIPAddress	Framed-IP-Address
radiusFramedIPNetmask	Framed-IP-Netmask
radiusFilterId		Filter-Id
radiusIdleTimeout	Idle-Timeout
radiusServiceType	Service-Type
radiusSessionTimeout	Session-Timeout
